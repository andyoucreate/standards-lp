# Content Editing Guide

## Where to Edit Content

All text content is centralized in the `mocks/` folder for easy editing:

```
mocks/
├── benefits.tsx       # Product benefits section
├── collaboration.tsx  # Integration logos and text
├── community.tsx      # Community/testimonials
├── comparison.tsx     # Feature comparison table
├── faq.tsx            # Frequently asked questions
├── features.tsx       # Features list
├── how-it-works.tsx   # Step-by-step guide
├── how-to-use.tsx     # Usage instructions
├── pricing.tsx        # Pricing plans
├── roadmap.tsx        # Product roadmap
└── testimonials.tsx   # Customer testimonials
```

## Navigation & Links

Edit navigation in `constants/`:

```
constants/
├── navigation.tsx     # Header/footer navigation links
└── socials.tsx        # Social media links
```

## Content Structure

### Typical Mock File

```tsx
// mocks/features.tsx
export const features = [
  {
    id: "1",
    title: "Feature Title",
    description: "Feature description text...",
    icon: "/images/icons/feature-icon.svg",
  },
  // Add more items...
];
```

### Editing Tips

1. **Keep strings concise** - Landing pages need scannable content
2. **Use consistent tone** - Professional but approachable
3. **Update all languages** - If i18n is added later
4. **Test line breaks** - Check how text wraps on mobile

## Images

### Location
All images are in `public/images/`:
- `benefits/` - Benefit cards and icons
- `features/` - Feature screenshots
- `hero/` - Hero section images
- `icons/` - UI icons

### Guidelines
- Use SVG for icons when possible
- Optimize images before adding
- Use descriptive filenames
- Recommended sizes:
  - Icons: 24x24 or 48x48
  - Cards: 400x300
  - Hero: 1200x800

## Brand Voice

### Do
- Be clear and direct
- Focus on developer benefits
- Use technical terms appropriately
- Highlight type safety and flexibility

### Don't
- Use marketing fluff
- Over-promise features
- Use jargon without context
- Write walls of text
